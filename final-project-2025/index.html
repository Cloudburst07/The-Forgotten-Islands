    <!-- 
    limited visibility
    advancing wall of doom
    running outta space
    minimalism
    trying to escape, break the system
    the more you have, the worse it is
    

    schizophrenia where things seem to appear in unexplored locations but once you look there,
    theres nothing? but if you dont do anything... something bad happens? eyes in the dark typa feel
    maybe incorporate dark jungle rule? dont be seen or die but as a plot twist... the player doesn't
    know at the start that they shouldve stayed hidden and quiet.

    permadeath + dead zone if venture too far
    time manipulation (time stop? rewind?)
    theme of slowly dying organism in apocalyptic setting (delaying the inevitable AKA decay)
    make the player feel lonely and despair (maybe using the unknown/exploration/limited visibility for that)

    the enemies/food sometimes randomly run away from a direction
    make the player be able to bump into smt invisible (even with scan), but enemies seem to see it
    DONE!on scan, enemies/food run away from you (afraid to be seen by the "thing")

    lower the health/higher decay = lower sanity, more 

    enemies as eyes, closed most times, but open sometimes and look left and right before closing

    use sound a LOTTT
    random floating stuff, maybe flashing lights, anyways smt new thatll pique the player's interest
    then drop disturbing lore

    make the player have a blood trail (particles or smt that shows their slow death/decay/need to eat)

    About the leviathan: distant or close sounds indicating its presence... but make it seem a bit like just
    atmosphere
    sounds as mostly random events- and make the enemies react to it
    if the player accidentally scans the leviathan... distort the scan and the screen or blocking scan/black zone
    use lots of distant silhouette (always partially shown)
    
    enemy behaviour where they would look towards a direction at the same time, freeze for a bit, then run

# ‚úÖ OVERALL GOAL:

**Explore islands to gather fragments of the Leviathan‚Äôs true name.**
**Stay alive by avoiding decay and not drawing too much attention.**
**At the end, banish the Leviathan by speaking its name.**

---

# üó∫Ô∏è CORE SYSTEMS TO-DO LIST

## 1. üß± BASIC STRUCTURE

### World

* [X] Build map of interconnected islands using tiles (4x4 to 10x10 each).
* [X] Connect islands with traversable paths/bridges.
* [X] Add collision blocks to prevent falling off.

### Player

* [X] Implement player movement.
* [X] Add health + decay bar.
* [X] Add idle/decay mechanic (if player stands still too long, decay rises).

---

## 2. üß† SANITY & DECAY SYSTEM

* [ ] Create `leviathanAggro` variable (0‚Äì100) based on:

  * [ ] Scanning
  * [ ] Eating/interacting
  * [ ] Stepping or lingering in cursed areas

* [ ] Create `decay` variable (0‚Äì100) based on:

  * [ ] Idle time
  * [ ] Delay in progress
  * [ ] Entering dead zones

* [ ] Display basic UI feedback (e.g., flickering screen, red edges, sound distortion)

---

## 3. üêç LEVIATHAN BEHAVIOR (Based on `leviathanAggro`)

* [ ] Level 1: Invisible (only audio/sound hints)
* [ ] Level 2: Appears in corner flickers
* [ ] Level 3: Breaches nearby tiles or bridges, rarely attacks
* [ ] Level 4: Hunts actively across map

### Optional:

* [ ] Add random Leviathan events: flashes, whispers, distortion

---

## 4. üß© CLUE SYSTEM (Name Fragments)

* [ ] Choose 3‚Äì5 unique islands to hide clues

* [ ] Design each clue as:

  * [ ] Glyph/symbol/syllable with visual + sound
  * [ ] Puzzle to unlock the clue (scan something, feed, interact)

* [ ] Add false clues or decoys on other islands

* [ ] Store fragments as array:

```js
let nameFragments = []; // e.g., ["Ktha", "Zirn", "Omhaal"]
```

---

## 5. üí° PUZZLE PROGRESSION

* [ ] Require clues to progress certain paths or bridges
* [ ] Optionally create island "checkpoints" that require a clue to proceed
* [ ] Use found clues to:

  * [ ] Unlock more islands
  * [ ] Give partial protection from Leviathan (short delay)

---

## 6. üëÅÔ∏è FINAL RITUAL

* [ ] Create final island (The Eye, The Maw, The Monolith)
* [ ] Create input UI:

  * [ ] Player must choose correct name order
  * [ ] Allow 1‚Äì2 chances or increase Leviathan aggression on fail
* [ ] Handle success:

  * [ ] Banish Leviathan (cutscene, fadeout, collapse)
* [ ] Handle failure:

  * [ ] Leviathan emerges fully ‚Äî endgame death or corrupted loop

---

## 7. üîä AUDIO / ATMOSPHERE (ongoing polish)

* [ ] Add ambient sound engine
* [ ] Leviathan whispers/pulses tied to aggro level
* [ ] Cues when decay is high (e.g., tinnitus, distortion)
* [ ] Change music layers per island
* [ ] Add silence or reversed music to key areas

---

## 8. ‚ú® POLISH AND FLAVOR

* [ ] Add blood trail mechanic (if health low)
* [ ] Add hallucination tiles/entities (especially with high decay)
* [ ] Add floating lore objects (logs, drawings, whisper memories)
* [ ] Implement subtle hints toward puzzle solution in the environment
* [ ] Consider using sound-based jump scares *sparingly*

---

## üì¶ OPTIONAL (if you have time)

* [ ] Add a journal screen or whispering UI to track found clues
* [ ] Let the player *speak* the Leviathan‚Äôs name mid-game (and cause a reaction)
* [ ] Implement a "false ending" for players who fail but think they succeeded
